                        Church street first in Bengaluru was an award wining sandbox for bringing together government, market, research institutions and society into a sandbox that allowed people to experience streets of the future.

It enabled creative artists from across the city to engage the public, even today church street in Bengaluru carries the legacy of busking and artists like Ed Sheeran performing there.
