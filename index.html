        <p style="text-align: justify;">
           <strong class="text-success">Urban Morph</strong> has been working on clean energy transition. We address the entire gamut of the transition from walking and cycling as modes for full trips or as last mile to public transport. We also work on helping Vehicle OEM’s and buildings to replace fossil fuels with battery energy. We do this by investing in technologies that can measure and quantify the energy used and saved. Whether you are from the industry grappling with the pathway to Net Zero or the government finding it challenging to implement a coherent roadmap. We can get it done.
